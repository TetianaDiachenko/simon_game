# Simon game

[Demo](https://tetianadiachenko.github.io/simon_game/)

## Rules

* Press the POWER button to switch on the game
* Press the START button. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.
* Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.
* Continue playing to the 10 times. 
* You'll win if all the repeatings are correct. 

The code for the game was written based on the video [Simon Game JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ)

I changed a little bit the code in HTML and CSS: added semantic tags, hid checkboxes and made buttons for more usability.
